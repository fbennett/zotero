============
`locale-rev`
============

This directory is used by the `locale_update.py` tool, run
immediately before a release to reconcile non-English locales
with the English master.

The directory holds (possibly partial) native locale data,
typically copied in from the Zotero 4.0 branch. This is the
normal channel for locale updates prior to release.
